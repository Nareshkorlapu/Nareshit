Write a C program using the ternary operator to calculate the electricity bill for a given number of units consumed by a customer.
For the first 100 units, the rate is Rs. 3.00 per unit.
For any additional units beyond 100, the rate is Rs. 4.50 per unit.

Example 1: Units consumed less than or equal to 100
Sample Input: units consumed : 75
Sample Output: The total electricity bill is: Rs. 225.00
        
Example 2: Units consumed more than 100
Sample Input: units consumed: 150
Sample Output: The total electricity bill is: Rs. 525.00
        
Example 3: Units consumed exactly 0
Sample Input: units consumed: 0
Sample Output: The total electricity bill is: Rs. 0.00
ANS:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int unitsConsumed;
    float totalBill;

    // Input the number of units consumed
    printf("Enter the units consumed: ");
    scanf("%d", &unitsConsumed);

    // Calculate the total bill using ternary operator
    totalBill = (unitsConsumed <= 100) ? (unitsConsumed * 3.0) : 
                (100 * 3.0 + (unitsConsumed - 100) * 4.5);

    // Output the result
    printf("The total electricity bill is: Rs. %.2f\n", totalBill);

    return 0;
}

Que 3 : 
=======

Devlop a program on a payroll system for a company. The system needs to calculate the salary of an employee based on their employee type ('M' for manager or 'H' for HR employee) and their basic salary. 
For managers, their salary should be increased by 10% as a performance bonus and for HR  increased by 5% . Write a C program that takes the employee type and basic salary as inputs and calculates the increased salary using the ternary operator.

Que 4 :
=======

Write a Cprogram to print sum of N natural numbers without using loops.

Sample input : int n = 10
Sample output : 55
ANS:
// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n,sum;
    printf("Enter the num:");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    sum=n*(n+1)/2;
    printf("sum of the all natural numbers:%d",sum);

    return 0;
}
