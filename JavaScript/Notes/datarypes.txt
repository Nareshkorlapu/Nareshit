Javascript is dynamically typed language
The datatype of a variable is decided by elements value in it. It can be changed with value.
Changing one datatype to another datatype is called "type casting". There are two types of type casting i.e...,=>Implicit and Explicit type casting
Implicit , without external force , it converts one datatype to another
Explicit, We need force to convert one datatype to another

There are two classifications of datatypes in Javascript
1.Primitive Data Types:
    i.number: number is datatype assigned to any numerical value
    eg:5,5.369(there is no int,float,boolean datatypesin jS)
    ii.String: String is a collection of characters. String can be represented by '' or "".
    eg: 'raj',"rani"(there is no char in JS we can use both single and double quoatations in JS)
    iii.Boolean : It is used to declare true or false. True is 1 and false is 0.
    iv.Undefined: It is used to store "undefined" data.
    v.Null: It is used to store "null" data.
2.Non Primitive Data Types:
    i.Functions:
    ii.Arrays:
    iii.Objects:



i) Number: Any numerical data is number , to find data type of an element , we can use typeof Operator
    numbers have some default method called "Math Methods"
